## Requirements

- Django == 3.2.9
- zmq
- CoppeliaSim Simulator [Download](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads)

## Steps to run the Simulation

- Launch CoppeliaSim and open the scene `V-REP_models/dVRK_training_peg_on_board.ttm`. This is our simulation Enviornment.

- Launch Python server made using Django for controlling dVRK simulation using `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`. The dvrk controller can be accessed on the link 127.0.0.1:8000

- If accessing the controller through smartphone, replace 127.0.0.1 by the host ip address.
  eg. 10.42.0.1:8000

- Run the script to communicate with CoppeliaSim simulation using `python async_img_sensor.py`

## Notes

- VREP_scenes were taken from []()
- zmqRemoteApi was taken from CoppeliaSim package.
